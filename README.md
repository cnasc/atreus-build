# My Atreus Build


<a id="orgcd78219"></a>

## Goals

-   [X] Have fun building something
-   [X] Improve my soldering skills
    -   For the first time, after years of inept fumbling, I managed to
        complete a soldering project without burning myself.
-   [X] Get a nifty looking ergonomic keyboard
-   [X] Improve my typing skills by reinforcing good habits
    -   I have always been a "semi-touch-typer;" I can mostly touch-type
        but I have some really bad habits in terms of finger
        positioning. I have tried to correct this by consciously typing
        the "right way" but the habit is too deep. By moving to a keyboard
        where some of my bad habits are actually impossible, I have been
        able to eliminate them.

## The Build


<a id="orgd15725a"></a>

### Finishing the Wood

I like a satiny finish on wood, so I disregarded the instructions
recommendation of lacquer and decided to wax the wood parts. This is,
in the woodworking community, regarded as a Bad Decision because wax
is a finish that has a lot of tradeoffs. In particular, it isn't very
durable. However, I am not overly concerned with durability of the
finish. Unlike a kitchen table or other surface, I won't touch the
wooden parts very frequently, since my hands will be on the keys.

Four coats of wax yields a smooth satiny finish that looks quite nice
with the porous wood. However, I neglected to consider how the wax
would impact the rubber feet that go on the bottom of the
case. Result: they don't stick well. Now I have them superglued on.

If I were to do it again knowing what I do now I would not do the wax
finish, but either:

-   Shellac
-   Spray lacquer

### Soldering the Diodes, Microcontroller, and Switches

Straightforward enough. A "third-hand" tool to hold the board in place
is helpful. Not much to say about this, take your time
and ensure that your joints are good. I got everything to work the
first time.

If I were to do it again, I might consider going with Cherry switches
instead of the ALPS included in the kit. With Cherry you get more
choices in terms of keycaps (more on that later) and the two
"sideways" switches in the middle will be easier to put in. That said,
I quite like the ALPS switches. They were one of the things that drew
me to the Atreus, since my previous keyboard was a Matias Mini Tactile
Pro.

### Putting It All Together

My two major diversions here were keycaps and edge-binding.

1.  Edge Binding

    I'm a big fan of the aesthetic of [Danelectro Guitars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelectro), which it turns
    out are guitars made of layers of plywood or cheap softwood (depending
    on when the example in question was made). To hide their edges, they
    used a textured tape. I found someone on eBay who sold the tape, asked
    him to cut me a length with width of a 1/2 inch. It went on nicely and
    holds well so far. I didn't do any special preparation to the edges,
    so I was a bit concerned about how well it would stick.

2.  Keycaps

    It's hard to find interesting ALPS keycaps. All the neat sets you see
    are only available for Cherry switches. The Atreus kit comes with
    blank keycaps, but I wanted to spice it up a little. 
    
    I went to a vintage computing festival a few weeks before starting my
    build, and I still had visions of those old keyboards in my mind. I
    looked up which manufacturers used ALPS switches back then thinking I
    would just buy an old keyboard that looked nice, and pull the caps.
    
    Lo and behold, Apple was a prolific user of ALPS switches in the '80s
    and since I currently use an iMac it seemed appropriate to go with
    those. So I got enough keycaps to cover the top 3 rows of the board
    and used the blank caps on the bottom row, for which it would be hard
    to find labeled analogs.
